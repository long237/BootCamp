#Introduction to Python

#Comments
#Any line with the symbol "#", at the begining will be ignored by Python
#Such as this one

#Print Statements
print("Hello World")
print('Hello World')

#Numbers and variables
#Just like in math, you can save values such as number into variables

x = 5       #integer
y = 2.64    #float
z = 3.14

#Printing numbers to the console

print("Value of x:", x)

#Saving Strings to a variable

a = "Hello"
b = "Long"

#Combingning and printing Strings (String Concatenation)
#What would be the value of c ?

c = a + b
print(c)
print("Hello" + b)
print("hello" + "Long")
